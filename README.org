*Warning: Here be dragons!*

This is my attempt at creating configurable model for mounting openlock terrain
to a wall. The goal is to be adjustable (with a screw) to make it both very
tight and also allow for a wall, no wall, and a foreground piece (such as a
short wall, arch, or a "half tile"). Bonus is we'd be able to support a full tile
(about 1 inch or 25mm).

I know enough about OpenSCAD to be dangerous. Feel free to mock my approaches
but only if you have suggestions on how to make it better ;)
